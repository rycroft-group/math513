# Unit 1: Singular value decomposition (SVD)
This directory contains several examples used in Unit 1 on singular value decomposition.

## Lecture 9: Low-rank approximation, image processing

Examples in this lecture were adapted from [Harvard AM205 Group Activity "SVD for image processing"](https://github.com/chr1shr/am205_g_activities/tree/master/svd_image_processing), created Jovana Andrejevic.

### The `image_compression.ipynb` notebook

The Python notebook contains the example on compressing and reconstructing a single image via the low-rank approximation.

### The `image_denoising.ipynb` notebook

The Python notebook contains the example of using the SVD to denoise a set of similar stamp images.
