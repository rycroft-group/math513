# Unit 0: Fundamentals
This directory contains several introductory examples used in Unit 0 on the fundamentals of numerical linear algebra.

## The `0_fundamentals.ipynb` notebook

The Python notebook contains the same code and functionality in the Python scripts below. It combines the scripts into an interactive format, making it easier to run, visualize results, and make modifications directly within the notebook environment.

## Lecture 3: Norms

### The `norm.py` example

The program `norm.py` plots the $p$-norm and infinity norm of an arbitrary vector. The program can be run by typing the following command in the terminal:

```Shell
python3 norm.py
```

### The `norm_unit_circle.py` example

The program `norm_unit_circle.py` plots four different norms of the unit circle. The program can be run by typing the following command in the terminal:

```Shell
python3 norm_unit_circle.py
```

### The `norm_unit_circle_image.py` example

The program `norm_unit_circle_image.py` plots four different norms of the unit circle under a linear transformation. The program can be run by typing the following command in the terminal:

```Shell
python3 norm_unit_circle_image.py
```

## Lecture 5: Floating point arithmetic and matrix visualization

### The `float.py` example

The program `float.py` demonstrates how floating point arithmetic works in Python. The program can be run by typing the following command in the terminal:

```Shell
python3 float.py
```

### The `float_precision.py` example

The program `float_precision.py` demonstrates benign loss of precision and significant loss of precision due to cancellation. The program can be run by typing the following command in the terminal:

```Shell
python3 float_precision.py
```

### The `vizmat.py` example

The program `vizmat.py` demonstrates how to visualize a two-dimensional matrix in Python. The program can be run by typing the following command in the terminal:

```Shell
python3 vizmat.py
```

### The `vizmat_3d.py` example

The program `vizmat_3d.py` demonstrates how to make 3D surface plot of 2D matrices in Python. The program can be run by typing the following command in the terminal:

```Shell
python3 vizmat_3d.py
```
